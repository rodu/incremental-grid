# Incremental Grid

## Pushing data to the DOM with RxJS

This was a nice exercise to learn the mechanism of pushing data, (versus pulling as we are normally used to) using RxJS. In reality, I also needed this component for other adaptation in a different project, so I decided to develop something first in isolation, and that's the why behind this little project.

The data set can be configured to produce any number of rows, and for each row a set of cells with random data can be generated.

In a more realistic scenario we could have such data coming from Ajax requests, or a different source.

The objective of this project was to understand the mechanism that can be used, and to provide an initial solution that can be built upon.
